# Rockbuster Stealth Online Video Service - Project Overview

I am thrilled to introduce Rockbuster Stealth's venture into the digital realm. As the newly onboarded data analyst within the Business Intelligence (BI) department, my mission is to facilitate the launch of our online video rental service. With competition from streaming giants intensifying, Rockbuster Stealth aims to leverage its extensive movie licenses by migrating to the online domain.

My initial task involves loading Rockbuster's comprehensive dataset into a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). Armed with SQL, I will delve into the data to address critical questions posed by various departments. From identifying the movies that significantly impact revenue to determining the average rental duration, my analyses will provide actionable insights.

As I navigate the data landscape, I'll uncover the geographical distribution of our customer base, identify locations with high lifetime value customers, and assess sales variations across regions. These insights will be pivotal in shaping our strategy for sustained competitiveness in the evolving landscape of online video services. Welcome to a data-driven chapter in Rockbuster's journey - where I, as the data analyst, lead the charge towards a successful digital transformation.
