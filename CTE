Here is the SQL query with CTE(Common Table Expression) where the query logic is encapsulated within a CTE named "total_amount_paid."
The final SELECT statement calculates the average of the total amounts paid by top 5 customers from the CTE.

WITH total_amount_paid (customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city, total_amount) AS
(SELECT E.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, D.country, C.city,
           SUM(E.amount) AS total_amount
    FROM payment E
    INNER JOIN customer A ON E.customer_id = A.customer_id
    INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
    INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
    INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
    WHERE C.city IN (
        SELECT C.city
        FROM CUSTOMER A
        INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
        INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
        INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
        WHERE C.country_id IN (
            SELECT D.country_id
            FROM CUSTOMER A
            INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
            INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
            INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
            GROUP BY D.country_id
            ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
            LIMIT 10
        )
        GROUP BY C.city
        ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
        LIMIT 10
    )
    GROUP BY E.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, D.country, C.city
    ORDER BY total_amount DESC
    LIMIT 5)

SELECT AVG(total_amount) AS average
FROM total_amount_paid;



Here is the query to find top 5 customers using CTE based on top 10 countris and cities.

WITH top_5_customer(customer_id,first_name,last_name,
country,city,total_amount) AS
(
SELECT E.customer_id,A.first_name,A.last_name,
D.country,C.city,sum(E.amount) AS total_amount
FROM payment E
INNER JOIN customer A on E.customer_id = A.customer_id
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
WHERE C.city IN
(
SELECT C.city
FROM CUSTOMER A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
WHERE C.country_id IN
(
SELECT D.country_id
FROM CUSTOMER A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
GROUP BY D.country_id
ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 10
)
GROUP BY C.city
ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 10)
GROUP BY E.customer_id,A.first_name,A.last_name,
D.country,C.city
ORDER BY total_amount DESC
LIMIT 5
) 
SELECT D.country,
	   count(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
	   count(DISTINCT CTE.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
LEFT JOIN
top_5_customer CTE 
ON D.country = CTE.country
