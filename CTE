Here is the SQL query with CTE(Common Table Expression) where the query logic is encapsulated within a CTE named "total_amount_paid." The final SELECT statement calculates the average of the total amounts from the CTE.

WITH total_amount_paid (customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city, total_amount) AS
(SELECT E.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, D.country, C.city,
           SUM(E.amount) AS total_amount
    FROM payment E
    INNER JOIN customer A ON E.customer_id = A.customer_id
    INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
    INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
    INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
    WHERE C.city IN (
        SELECT C.city
        FROM CUSTOMER A
        INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
        INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
        INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
        WHERE C.country_id IN (
            SELECT D.country_id
            FROM CUSTOMER A
            INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
            INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
            INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
            GROUP BY D.country_id
            ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
            LIMIT 10
        )
        GROUP BY C.city
        ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
        LIMIT 10
    )
    GROUP BY E.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, D.country, C.city
    ORDER BY total_amount DESC
    LIMIT 5)

SELECT AVG(total_amount) AS average
FROM total_amount_paid;
